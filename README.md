# Applying Machine Learning to Advance Cybersecurity
**CYBERSEC 520 – Foundations of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity (Spring 2026)**  
Duke University

## Overview
This repository contains coursework for **CYBERSEC 520**, a graduate-level course focused on applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to modern cybersecurity problems.

The course covers the full AI lifecycle in security contexts, including data preprocessing, classical machine learning, deep learning, large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, and secure deployment practices. Emphasis is placed on both **AI for Cybersecurity** (using AI to enhance security operations) and **Security of AI** (protecting AI systems from threats).

## Topics Covered
- Classical machine learning for cybersecurity (anomaly detection, classification)
- Feature engineering and handling imbalanced security datasets
- Ensemble methods and model evaluation
- Deep learning architectures (DNNs, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain adaptation
- LLM security (prompt injection, data poisoning, model extraction)
- Agentic AI systems for SOC automation
- Model deployment, MLOps, and monitoring
- AI risk management, governance, and ethics in cybersecurity
